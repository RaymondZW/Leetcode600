In a dict, accessing value associated with a key that is not present leads to a KeyError exception. However, a collecitons.defaultdict returns the default value oft hetype that was specified whe n the collection was inwtantiated. if d = collections.defaultdict(list), then if k not in d then d[k] is []. A collections.Counter is used for counting the nubmer of occurrences of keys, with a numbrer of set-like oeprations, as illustarted below

c = collections.Counter(a=3, b=1)
d = collections.Counter(a=1, b=2)

# add two counts tgt, c[x] + d[x], collections.Counter({'a': 4, 'b':3})

c + d
subtrace
